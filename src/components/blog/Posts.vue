          img: "post-img.png",
          description: `Saving and investing are however a bit different from each other, but they share a common goal
of financial stability. Saving and investing are equally important as both have their own
advantages and disadvantages.
People often don't know whether to invest or save, but before you begin your journey to
achieving your dreams of massive wealth and financial stability, you need to be very clear about
these basic but very important financial concepts. Let's talk,
<h3>What is investing?</h3>
Investing is not without risk but it is very rewarding, it involves buying assets which can include
real estate, bonds, stocks, cryptocurrencies etc. with a higher chance that their value increases
over time.
Nowadays, real estate is a very promising option in which to invest because the risks of loss are
very low. If you invest in real estate, your assets multiply in a few years.
It works so that you don't have cash readily available, you have to sell your assets when you
need cash or when you need to increase your capital gains.
<h3>What is saving?</h3>
Money saved for future emergencies and anticipated needs is called savings. Savings are
mostly risk-free, deposited in a bank account offering a fixed monthly return.
Saving is beneficial in that whenever you are in a state of emergency or need money
immediately, you don't have to borrow it from anyone. No money arrangement worries, your
savings will save you.
<h3>The benefits of investing</h3>
Investments are very rewarding, some businesses like real estate can come in very handy as
there is very little risk of loss.
Other activities like stocks, cryptocurrency are also very rewarding, but they involve more risk
than real estate.
There is no doubt that you can easily overcome inflation, if you invest wisely. You can increase
your wealth at a rate much higher than the rate of inflation in comparison.
<h3>Disadvantages of investing</h3>
Investments are undoubtedly rewarding, but they are also very risky. If you don't invest wisely,
there is a huge chance that you will end up losing your wealth.
Investments Involve a large amount of research, where and when to invest and if you are
unwilling to do so, a wrong decision can result in an unbearable loss.
Investments are generally volatile which means that if you are in dire need of cash you may
have to wait for your assets to be sold, this may take a day a week a month or even longer
leaving you in a situation stressful.
When you invest in different companies, it is quite possible that a certain percentage of your
money will be lost in taxes.
<h3>Where to invest?</h3>
Money is never easy to earn, so you have to be very smart and vigilant when investing in any
business. Businesses like the stock market, stocks and cryptocurrency are useful but they are
extremely risky and you can lose your wealth in no time.
Real estate, on the other hand, is an activity with the lowest level of risk, there are almost
negligible chances that a property will lose value over time rent without losing its worth
<h3>Why is savings important?</h3>
Savings are very liquid, this means you don't have to wait when you need money, just go to the
bank and withdraw the money you need. In short, savings is money without stress.
Savings has fixed returns without any loss, although the returns are not very high, but you still
get a fixed amount at the end of the month.
Savings are very easy to make, you just have to make a decision. No research, no hidden fees
or risks involved, very easy to sue.
Savings are usually tax free or offer a very low amount of taxes, lots of money is saved instead
of wasted on taxes.
<h3>Disadvantages of savings</h3>
Savings offer a very low return, you limit a significant amount of income and get a very low
return. Often the returns do not exceed 8-10% of the total money reserved in your account.
The money saved continues to lose value as inflation continues to rise day by day. If you have
to buy something, its value increases from time to time, but the value of the currency does not
change. Therefore, you are at a loss.
<h3>What is better saving or better investing?</h3>
The best decision depends on your financial situation and the financial goals you want to
achieve. Depending on your goal, sometimes it's better to save and sometimes to invest, while
sometimes it's better to have a combination of the two.
The goal can be short term, medium term or long term, now let’s discuss based on the goal
which would be a better option to choose.
<h3>Short term goals</h3>
It is better to save rather than invest for short term goals in the form of cash or cash deposits in
your bank accounts, as investments are long and risky, you should not lose your money in a few
years .
If you are well aware of your needs in the near future or if you need to buy a house or a car or
anything for your needs within five years, savings will be a better option because investing less
than five years is not worth doing and a lot of reward.
<h3>Medium-term objectives</h3>
A mix of saving and investing will be a better choice for medium term goals, if you save all your
money, inflation may impact it causing a loss.
Investing part of your money will help you minimize the consequences of inflation, while the
other part of the money saved will help you deal with any financial emergency.
If your needs are flexible and you are willing to take the risk, investing in the current scenario
will not be a bad option either, because investing some of the money will minimize the effect of
inflation but cannot. completely overcome.
<h3>Long term goals</h3>
Investing will be the best option if you are pursuing long term goals, if you are saving for the
long term you will fall victim to inflation.
Inflation over time affects the value of money. As inflation rises, money continues to lose value,
but your assets don't. As inflation increases, the value of your assets also increases, so you will
not be affected by inflation in this particular case.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Investing and saving are both important, it is your financial goals and your financial situation that
will help you decide whether to invest or save. Savings are risk free but offer low returns while
investments are highly rewarding but just as risky.
If saving is your option you don't need much research but to invest you need to be well aware of
the business you are investing in, a lot of research and knowledge will be required to execute
your investment in completely safe.`

          title: "Facts about PIA",
          img: "post-img.png",
          description: `<h3>Update: (July 21, 2022):</h3>
Following the recent drop in fuel prices, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has revised its
domestic and international fares. According to the details, PIA has reduced the price of tickets
for international flights by 15%, while domestic air fares have been reduced by 10%. PIA's
decision to cut fares has brought relief to people who use the national carrier for frequent air
travel.
<h3>Update (28 Feb 2022):</h3>
SPECIAL FLIGHT OPERATIONS BY PIA FOR PAKISTANI STUDENTS STRANDED IN
UKRAINE AT WAR
In an interview with a renowned news TV channel, Air Marshal, CEO of Pakistan International
Airlines (PIA), Arshad Malik, said that preparations had been made to safely bring home the
Pakistani students stranded from war-stricken Ukraine.
The country's flag carrier was in talks with the Foreign Office and the leadership was waiting for
a green signal to be able to launch special air operations for students trapped in the war-torn
country.
According to Pakistan's Ambassador to Ukraine, Dr. Noel I Khokhar, hundreds of Pakistani
expatriates are currently facing the consequences of the Russian-Ukrainian war. Details of the
flights would be released as soon as there are further developments.
<h3>Update (February 18, 2022):</h3>
NEXT PIA DIRECT FLIGHT OPERATIONS TO INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS
The country's national airline is constantly striving to expand its direct flight operations to more
international destinations to make travel easier for travelers.
<h3>DIRECT FLIGHTS TO SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</h3>
In a recent development, Pakistan International Airlines has decided to launch direct flight
operations to Australia. According to initial plans, there would be two flights a week - a return
flight between the Australian city of Sydney and Karachi as well as a one-way flight from Lahore
to Sydney.
Plans are to include the capital of Islamabad at a later stage. Currently, it takes passengers up
to 35 hours to travel between Pakistan and Australia with a few stopovers, which could be a
boring and tedious experience. However, with the launch of direct flights, travel time is expected
to be reduced to almost a third.
“If it happened, it would happen for the first time. We have studied the feasibility, which indicates
that it would be beneficial for the airline,” said PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez.
<h3>Update (Oct 27, 2021):</h3>
The national airline's fleet is expanding. A newly acquired A320 aircraft by PIA made a safe
landing at Islamabad International Airport (IIA) on Saturday, October 23, 2021.
Pakistan International Airline has signed a six-year bareboat lease for the induction of two
A320s to modernize its fleet and expand its network of flight operations. The first of the two
recently acquired A320s already arrived in the country a month ago.
After recent additions to the fleet, PIA has a total number of 11 A320 aircraft in service.
Currently, the national airline's fleet has 29 aircraft of different brands. According to PIA
management, more aircraft will soon be acquired by the airline to expand its capacity to serve
domestic and international travellers.
Here is a recent tweet from PIA CEO and former Air Marshal Arshad Malik, in which he proudly
announces the arrival of the newly inducted aircraft and recognizes the hard work and
dedication of the management and staff of the airline company.
With dozens of aircraft in its fleet, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is the country's largest
airline. The national airline of Pakistan is also among the oldest and most popular airlines in the
world.
<h3>HISTORY OF INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES OF PAKISTAN</h3>
Digging into the facts regarding the history of PIA, we realize that the airline was founded in
1946 as Orient Airways. Its headquarters was in Calcutta, India before independence. However,
after 1947 the airline was nationalized to form Pakistan International Airlines. The newly formed
airline was based on a fleet of three L-I049C Super Constellations, two Convair CV-240s and
eleven DC-3 aircraft.
PIA's very first international flight took off in 1955. Routed to Heathrow Airport in London, this
PIA flight stopped in Cairo, Egypt, and Rome, Italy. PIA was also the very first airline in Asia to
have Boeing 707s in its fleet.
The airline also has a record for completing the world's longest commercial flight in 2005. This
was a non-stop flight completed in over twenty-two hours by a commercial airliner, the Boeing
777- 200LR. We will learn more about the aircraft in the PIA fleet later in this blog.

          title: "How to  become real estate agent_",
          img: "post-img.png",
          description: `Realtors are the people who connect buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants and earn a
commission for doing so. If you want to become a real estate agent, you should consider the
following factors:
<h3>What education do you need?</h3>
Although there are no notable institutions in our country that offer educational courses in real
estate, there is one in Karachi by the name of Pakistan Institute of Real Estate Management
(PIREM), which offers certificates and diplomas in real estate management and construction.
A real estate broker is a self-employed person who must have sufficient knowledge of business,
so obtaining a master's degree in business administration can come in handy. It should be noted
that in addition to business knowledge, gaining practical experience is equally imperative for a
real estate agent to excel in the field.
<h3>What should be the first step to enter the field?</h3>
A real estate broker must acquire enough practical experience, which is acquired when you start
working in the market. For beginners who are just entering the field, it is advisable to work with
an established real estate agency either as an employee or as an associate. You can set the
working conditions in advance to avoid unpleasant surprises later. For example, you can decide
to give a particular share of commission to the owner of the agency when you close a deal. This
will provide you with enough practical knowledge and experience to establish your own
business and goodwill in the market after some time.
<h3>Establishing your own agency</h3>
Establish your own agency when you feel you have acquired enough knowledge about real
estate transactions and are stable enough to establish your own setup. After deciding that,
decide on the name of your agency, set up an office in a location of your choice, register your
business, and start working like your own boss!
Thus, becoming a real estate broker is not as difficult as it seems. In my opinion, industry
knowledge and experience are an agent's most important assets, allowing them to thrive in the
market.`

          img: "post-img.png",
          description: `For most potential buyers in the market, price and square footage are the two ultimate factors to
consider before buying a home. But what happens when you come across two properties with
the same square footage and the same prices? Since you can't compare two properties the
same way you would compare other assets, like a vehicle or a smartphone, figuring out which
option is best for your needs could turn into a definite struggle.
<h3>Wondering what's the best way to do it?</h3>
Well, if you ever find yourself in a situation where you have to make a judgment on the value of
two nearly identical houses or apartments, you should take a look at some features of each unit
before making a decision. This blog will discuss the parameters that all investors and buyers
should keep in mind when choosing between two or more similar properties.
<h3>HOW TO COMPARE TWO ALMOST IDENTICAL PROPERTIES</h3>
Imagine encountering two different homes in slightly different locations, each structure meeting
all of the major requirements on your house hunting checklist perfectly. They also have a similar
market value and cover the same area. In a situation like this, how would you decide which
house to choose as your next residence and which to give up?
Needless to say, this decision can lead to a lot of regrets and doubts down the road. Therefore,
it is important to undertake meticulous due diligence and do your research before signing under
the dotted lines. Without further ado, these are the parameters you need to consider when
comparing homes to buy.
<h3>LOCATION</h3>
This one goes without saying. Location is the most important parameter in home buying
comparison. However, if you need to compare two properties in the same neighborhood, the
best way to go would be to consider their individual locations. For example, is a property located
on open land to the west? Is the other one near a park? Are both houses located in the suburbs
or near a busy road?
<h3>ARRANGEMENT</h3>
A practical layout is one of the main things that one should look for in a home for a family. It can
also have a significant impact on the attractiveness and value of a property.
Therefore, if you come across two houses or apartments that cost the same price and are
located in a similar area, you might want to consider their layout as the deciding factor. Keeping
your preferences and lifestyle choices in mind, try comparing homes side-by-side to determine
which has a better layout than the other.
Reading nooks, extra storage space, extra home office space and a dirty kitchen are some of
the most notable features that can make any property worthy of an investment.
<h3>BUILD QUALITY</h3>
Another important parameter is the build quality. When comparing homes to buy, ask the seller
about the year built, the quality of building materials, the type of paint used, the quality of
various fixtures and fittings, the durability of flooring, and , especially, if the structure has been
well maintained over the years.
If you think one property may need repairs and renovations in the next two years while the other
looks like new, you can go for the second option, provided they check the rest of the
requirements from your checklist.
<h3>AMENITIES AND FACILITIES</h3>
Certain amenities can increase the value of a property. This may include proximity to fully
functioning public transport, mosques, public parks, playgrounds, campuses of educational
institutions, hospitals and health centers, supermarkets and recreational areas . The availability
of shopping malls, banks, salons, fitness centers, and offices are also some of the most
sought-after amenities for many people when buying a home.
So, if one property is a bit closer to the bus stop than the other, it may make sense to invest
there. Likewise, if one house or apartment comes with one secure parking space but not the
other, you may need to re-evaluate your final decision accordingly.
<h3>CAPITAL GAINS</h3>
Whether you are buying a home for the first time or looking to generate a second stream of
income by investing in a rental unit, it is important to select a property located in a real estate
hotspot for ideal capital gains in the future.
For the uninitiated, real estate hotspots are suburban residential enclaves with relatively
affordable real estate options and the latest infrastructure. These areas are generally subject to
development work and are sparsely populated. However, once the city centers become
overcrowded and expensive, people begin to move to these new residential enclaves, allowing
real estate prices to rise.
<h3>Here is how you can identify real estate hotspots in Pakistan.</h3>
To conclude, if you ever need to compare two properties with similar prices, be sure to consider
their individual location, layout, build quality, amenities and project appreciations before making
your choice.`

He questioned not only the course of action, but also the existing policies to improve health
facilities, meet the basic needs of disadvantaged segments and, above all, revive the economy.
To overcome major economic disruptions and severe impacts, various countries have adopted
various techniques to mitigate the effects of the pandemic and revive the economy. Pakistan
has opted for revival of "construction and real estate industry".
The construction industry in Pakistan is worth over $50 billion, or about 12-13% of GDP. Of this
amount, the real estate sector contributes about 1/3 ($15 billion) of the total industry.
The industry catalyzes the entire supply chain including various components such as strategy
and transportation systems for delivery and accessibility, labor including day laborers, plumbers,
technicians, builders, builder management, etc. and the availability and supply of essential
construction materials, i.e. cement, sand, steel, paint, hardware, etc.
Despite the growing economic importance that the real estate sector has attributed to the
development of the economy, the true potential of the industry has remained hidden in Pakistan.
The construction and real estate industry impacts millions of lives across the country. Several
government and non-government departments, as well as public and private sector actors, have
worked tirelessly to bring together more than 50 allied industries.
Before moving on to how real estate is driving related industries, it is important to understand
the importance of the sector.
<h3>The Role of "Economic Infrastructure" in Activating an Economy</h3>
Whether it is the medium from which this article is written or read, the physical space from which
it originates or from where it is perceived, everything is related to real estate.
Construction and real estate provide efficient infrastructure where the economy works. It is not
only limited to the development of houses, but it also consolidates the space for businesses to
operate from high quality, modern and innovative buildings, industries being installed and
materials in factories. in production. Paved roads, rail and communication networks, dry
seaports, energy sources, financial systems and institutions, etc. are also a representation of
economic infrastructure. This factor determines the potential for economic growth and the ability
to engage effectively.
Simultaneously impacting all sectors and sub-sectors, real estate plays an important role in a
country's growth performance.
<h3>Untapped market opportunities and the introduction of Proptech, ConTech</h3>
As established above, the true potential of the construction and real estate investment industry
remained largely untapped, not only creating a market gap but also leaving Pakistan far behind
as other nations prospered.
In the midst of the fourth industrial revolution experienced globally, and considering the gap in
the market, various technological fields began to penetrate nationwide and were introduced,
including FinTech, EdTech, E-commerce, etc considering the gap in market and demand.
The construction and real estate industry, however, was the latest to embrace the technology,
i.e. Proptech. Where the world braced for the fourth wave of Proptech, Pakistan saw the second
and third waves nearly a decade ago.
After assessing the dynamics and gaps existing in the country's real estate sector, a subsidiary
Graana.com, under the Imarat group of companies, was established, with the aim of
transforming Pakistan's real estate sector.
As one of the pioneering Proptech startups, Pakistan's smartest real estate portal has reshaped
the industry by replacing traditional methods with an efficient ecosystem of transparent
transactions, in terms of buying, selling, renting and of investment.
Apart from transforming the sector, it is the only growing business group on the real estate value
chain in Pakistan, organized after extensive research to offer a transparent platform from
transactions and be a driving force for related industries.
1. Expansion of industry and national assets
The shutdown of economies, closure of orders, and suspension of trade due to the outbreak of
the pandemic have led to a sharp shift in consumer mindset and attitudes, leading to a change
in demand for products.
<h3>The main concern – health care supplies and perishables.</h3>
To overcome the economic impact of COVID-19 in Pakistan, the government has unveiled a
multi-billion rupee economic package worth Rs 900 billion, bringing relief to citizens, especially
low-income groups who have been hard hit by the pandemic.
Aimed at boosting economic activity and creating jobs, the announced initiative included a relief
package worth Rs. 100 billion for the construction industry and Rs. 100 billion to support small
industries and the agricultural sector, among various other relief initiatives.
Under the relief scheme, some of the significant initiatives provided were exemption from
withholding tax on materials in the construction sector, grant worth Rs 30 billion for Naya
Pakistan Housing Scheme and a provincially aligned sales tax cut.
To stimulate construction and real estate, the relief program incentivized allied industry and
paved the way for maximizing sales and economic growth during these difficult times.
With trade shut down, this has provided crucial opportunities for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) to expand their domain and services and promote domestic products locally.
<h3>Cement</h3>
Cement sales increased by 19.63% in the domestic market and were recorded at 3.835 million
tons in June 2020, compared to 3.206 million tons recorded in June 2019. On the other hand,
exports recorded at 0.351 million tons. tonnes in June 2019, jumped 123.89% to 0.787. million
tonnes in June 2020.
When comparing cement manufacturing units in different areas, it was pointed out by the
Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association (APCMA) that the northern region was stronger in
domestic consumption and the southern region in exports.
<h3>Steel</h3>
Along with COVID-19, demand for steel has been fueled by the wave of capital expenditure and
infrastructure projects such as power plants, dams, airports, road networks, development of
special economic zones ( ZES) and increased public and private investment. housing programs.
Currently, there are 200 steelmaking units in the country, with a combined capacity of over 4
million tons. The sector has successfully generated nearly Rs 100 billion in government
revenue.
<h3>construction machinery industry</h3>
Pakistan's domestic construction machinery industry has seen an increase in demand and
continues to increase.
The reason was attributed to the increased number of development projects being carried out.
Before the outbreak of COVID-19, many Japanese and European companies worked overtime
in the Pakistani market in various forms, either establishing joint ventures in the local market or
offering after-sales service stations in the local market.
The Pakistan Construction Industry Association (PSIA), which has 383 members, is
continuously working and successful in introducing the Pakistani market to international
companies.
With an increase in development projects across the country, the demand for other building
materials like hardware, paint, plumbing items, etc. is also on the rise.
<h3>2. Job generation</h3>
Being one of the most populous countries, the population of Pakistan is divided into several
classes, a large portion of which fall under the category of day laborers.
Being a day laborer has no fixed income, no job security, or even a way to earn a living. They
may belong to the category of skilled worker or unskilled worker. The coronavirus outbreak has
dismantled the ways to earn and even live for these segments.
In a bid to accommodate these segments, the government has allocated a sum of Rs 200 billion
to protect the economic interests of laborers and daily wage earners affected by COVID-19.
In addition, the “Ehsaas Emergency Cash Program” has also been launched to somewhat
alleviate the economic hardship faced by vulnerable groups due to the current crisis. Financial
assistance under the program covered 12 million families; allocating a sum of Rs12,000 per
family, with a total budget of Rs144 billion.
The revival of construction activities across the country has contrived to create jobs not only for
the disadvantaged segment of society, but also for others.
Currently, many development projects in the private and public sectors are underway, which
have created thousands of job opportunities.
<h3>3. Unmet housing demand</h3>
Housing demand is expected to be around 20 million units over the next 10 years.
Supply material, plumbing material, bricks, concrete, wood, etc. are all essential for building
houses. With various housing programs going on in both sectors, both private and public
sectors need to fill the existing housing gap and overcome the prevailing problem.
With this, all related allied industries have soared, especially amid COVID-19, due to lack of
international competition and an increase in demand. The process was also catalyzed by the
announced relief package for the construction industry.
<h3>4. Attract foreign direct investment</h3>
Despite facing a myriad of challenges in the form of political instability, growing security
concerns and a stagnant economy, Pakistan has managed to transform and improve investment
prospects.
FDI from Pakistan increased by $174.8 million in June 2020, compared to an increase of $120.0
million the previous month.
Positively attracting FDI sums represents the economic stability of a nation, taking note of FDI
and increasing capital inflows for various development projects such as CPEC, CAREC, etc.
highlight a secure funding environment and an important element of economic stability.
Over the past few months, Pakistan has managed to attract large volumes of investment for
various projects, especially for the promotion of the tourism industry.
The impacts of COVID-19 undoubtedly set the dynamics in different trajectories, which will
remain subject to significant changes in the months to come. As people wait to see the results
of the huge intervention undertaken by the government to mitigate the impacts, revive the
industry and stimulate economic growth. However, the need to research investment and
business ideas continues to grow as we speak.
Apart from identifying untapped sectors, Pakistan's construction real estate sector has provided
magnanimous investment opportunities including development of SEZs, boosting tourism
sector, different residential and commercial projects, etc. and the China-Pakistan Economic
Corridor (CPEC) as a game changer.`

worried about common investing mistakes you can make at this stage as well. These mistakes
can cost you energy, time and money.

mess anything up, but before that, let's note the most common mistakes majority investors
make.

etc.When no proper research is done, it is considered one of the biggest
mistakes avoided by all sane investors.

mistakes you need to avoid, and the solution is to make a proper plan before you take money

secure a contract from the construction workers who will be working on your site. Moreover, you
will need to hire a group of responsible people to get the best result.
For this, you can obtain references from your relatives whom you trust, and check their records
for your satisfaction, before hiring.

to sell it and be on the back end to help you financially if needed at any stage.

time. Otherwise, you may have to spend a lot more to get the property in its best shape.
When looking for a suitable employer for your property, be very careful. Ask such questions of
your tenant, which will help you ensure that you are renting a house to the right person, who will
keep your property in its best condition and pay the rent on time each month.`

          description: `Looking for a place to live where you can work and play? Are you tired of bearing the expenses
of huge houses? Perhaps a smaller, more private option is best for you: buy an apartment!
<h3>Apartments vs. Houses</h3>
Choosing where to live and how to manage has arisen the debate houses vs apartments. In
major cities of Pakistan such as Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore, new projects introducing luxury
and comfortable living have taken home construction.
<h3>What is the difference between living in a house or an apartment?</h3>
The difference between living in a house and living in an apartment is how each of them
provides facilities and how they offer a standard of living. Apartments are beneficial for people
like students and migrants who live on a budget and might need a smaller space initially.
Apartment vs House Advantages and Disadvantages
Most people often get confused in questions like what to choose from options like a house or an
apartment. The goal is to live a standard, moderate life, and also to be able to save enough for
luxuries.
Let's see how each of these plays out.
<h3>Benefits of living in an apartment</h3>
smaller space
more private
Ideal for small families
Easy to maintain
The lessor bears the maintenance costs.
Lots of next door neighbors to socialize with
Disadvantages of living in an apartment
Monthly rent
A shared gas/water/electricity connection can disrupt
Feels very small for large families
Difficult to cover events in such a limited space
<h3>Benefits of living in a house</h3>
An advantage
Ideal for large families
No privacy issues
Separate utility connections
<h3>Disadvantages of living in a house</h3>
More difficult to maintain
Expensive to maintain
You have to pay a lot of bills - the bigger the house, the bigger the bills
Property taxes
<h3>Cost of apartment vs house</h3>
Assessing the cost of the apartment versus the house is the first step to choosing the best one
for you. Apartments are cheaper than houses and better suited to students and working people
living away from home.
Living in a house can be difficult as it becomes difficult for them to work and take care of the
house at the same time.
Living in a unit or an apartment is more advantageous, especially with regard to the lease and
the bills. As an apartment will, in general, be much smaller than a house, less money will be
needed for gas and electricity bills. In addition, they are designed to maintain a temperature in
summer and winter naturally in order to minimize expenses.
While a lease in a house will, in general, be more expensive than an apartment, depending on
the number of people sharing it, if there are fewer people living in a large house and supporting
high charges will not be what a loss.
<h3>Are apartments safer than houses?</h3>
People who prefer to live in an apartment have a major location factor in mind while considering
the difference between living in an apartment or a house. The apartments are built on a site with
easy access to everything: shops, markets and hospitals nearby.
Apartments are safer as they are usually built inside a gated and gated community with 24/7
security monitoring. Islamabad Luxury Square Apartments is a prime example.
While choosing where to live and where to invest? The advantages and disadvantages of the
apartment compared to the house are taken into account. Here are some of the problems one
can face in an apartment.
<h3>Investment apartment vs house</h3>
Homes are the traditional and safe source of investment. If you are looking for long-term
strategic planning, you have to invest in houses. This is because market value increases over
time, and as homes become part of the estate, each passing year adds value to the property.
Obviously, investing in an apartment is better because it's a cheaper option, and you can buy 2
or 3 for the price of a large house if you're looking to rent it out.
You no longer have to worry if you don't have a large space for meetings or ceremonies.
Suppose you do not compromise with your privacy terms, it would be better if you look at
companies that have built apartments in a modern way.
<h3>Why are apartments better than houses?</h3>
Several projects in Pakistan are designed to provide all the amenities needed for a good
lifestyle. Apartments in Gulberg Greens Islamabad can be taken as an example where there is
not only a moderate standard of living but also a safe and secure investment.
People like to work and have a designated workspace in their apartment. From basic facilities to
sources of enjoyment, these apartment buildings are second to none and have solved all the
problems of the past.
The problem of investment in apartments or houses is also solved due to changing trends.
Investment in apartments can only be beneficial for you.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Living a life in which one can save money and enjoy the basic conveniences of life is worthy.
Apartments are better than houses in terms of expenses, responsibilities, pleasure and above
all work.`
